    "PPTX generated successfully (25 slides).",
    "The renderer saved the PPTX but exited with a subsequent error (NameError: argparse not defined). This appears to be a post-render exception and did not prevent the PPTX file from being written.",
    "Visual QA: basic MR checks executed; no critical MR-1 / MR-5 / MR-6 / MR-8 / MR-9 / MR-11 / MR-12 / MR-13 / MR-14 / MR-15 failures detected in a content-level validation run.  (See scripts/validate_mr.py output.)",
    "Rendered chart assets (SVG/PNG) were not found in images/ directory (only images/cover_bg.jpg present). The slides' visual.placeholder_data remain without 'rendered_svg_path' or 'rendered_png_path' entries.",
    "Recommendation: Have `ppt-specialist` re-run the renderer or run the chart-export step to produce SVG/PNG for charts and update slides_semantic.json with rendered asset paths. Also fix the post-render import issue (missing 'argparse' import near script end) to avoid the exception on exit."

    "After re-render: run scripts/validate_mr.py and scripts/check_charts.py to confirm charts were embedded or exported and slides_semantic.json updated."
