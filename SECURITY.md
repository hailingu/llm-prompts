# Security Policy

We appreciate reports of security issues. Please follow the guidance below to report potential vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a vulnerability

- Preferred: Use GitHub Security Advisories to report vulnerabilities privately.
- Alternatively, open a confidential issue and mark it `security` (do not include public PoCs).

Do not post sensitive vulnerability details publicly until a coordinated disclosure has occurred.

## Response

Maintainers aim to acknowledge security reports within 72 hours and will coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
