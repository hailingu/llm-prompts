# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, welcoming, and respectful community for contributors and maintainers.

## Our Standards

- Be respectful and constructive in discussion.
- Be welcoming to new contributors.
- Assume good faith and focus on the work, not the person.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to the maintainers via GitHub Issues or Discussions. Reports will be handled by the maintainers and the `coc-specialist` agent for enforcement and resolution.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reviewed by the maintainers and may result in consequences, including removal from the project.

We expect everyone to follow this code of conduct when interacting in any project space.
