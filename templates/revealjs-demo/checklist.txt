Accessibility & QA Checklist for Reveal.js demo

- [ ] All slides have <aside class="notes"> with Summary/Rationale/Evidence/Action/Risks
- [ ] Text contrast meets WCAG AA (normal text ≥4.5:1)
- [ ] All meaningful images/diagrams have aria-label or descriptive text (aria-describedby)
- [ ] Charts provide data tables or long descriptions for screen readers
- [ ] Keyboard navigation: ensure focusable interactive elements and visible focus styles
- [ ] Responsive design: two-column collapses into single column for small screens
- [ ] Motion reduced option: prefer reduced-motion when user has prefers-reduced-motion
